# 🧠 Unsupervised Learning Projects

This repository contains beginner-friendly practical examples of **Unsupervised Machine Learning**, including:

- ✅ Clustering (K-Means on customer/iris dataset)
- ✅ Anomaly Detection (Isolation Forest and Z-Score methods)
- ✅ Dimensionality Reduction (PCA visualization)

All examples are presented in an easy-to-understand way using **Excel, Google Sheets, and Visual Diagrams** — perfect for non-coders or those new to AI.
