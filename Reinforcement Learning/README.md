## 📝 Description:
This project presents a beginner-friendly, non-coding explanation of **Reinforcement Learning (RL)** through a visually rich diagram and a short write-up. It is designed for learners who want to showcase their understanding of AI concepts without programming.

## 🎯 Objectives:
- Understand the basic loop of Reinforcement Learning
- Visualize how an agent interacts with an environment
- Learn about the role of actions, rewards, and feedback in learning

## 📁 Folder Contents:
- `reinforcement_learning_concept.png` — Diagram explaining the RL loop
- `reinforcement_learning_summary.docx` — Simple explanation of the concept
- `README.md` — Project documentation

## 🔁 Reinforcement Learning Cycle:
1. **Agent** takes an **Action**.
2. **Environment** provides **Feedback** (Reward or Punishment).
3. Agent uses feedback to **Learn and Improve** next action.

## 🧠 Why This Project?
This project is ideal for:
- Beginners who want to build a **non-coding AI portfolio**
- Explaining concepts in interviews or presentations
- Visual learners starting their **AI journey**

## 📚 What You Learn:
- What is Reinforcement Learning?
- How RL differs from Supervised & Unsupervised Learning
- Practical examples of RL: self-driving cars, game playing bots, robots
